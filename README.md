This project investigates potential differences in Wi-Fi performance between Hanson Hall of Science and Old Main Hall on Augustana College (IL) campus, representing the sciences and humanities buildings respectively. The objective was to hypothesis test and assess if there are grounds to claim infrastructure inequality. The methodology involved collecting download and upload speed data at specific locations in each building over one week.
